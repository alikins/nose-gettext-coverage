A plugin for python-nose to check coverage of translated strings.


The basic idea is this keeps track of gettext calls, and checks
to see how many of the known translated strings are accessed
during the tests cases.

Example usage:

nosetests --with-gettext-cover --gettext-cover-pot-file po/keys.pot -v -d -s
.....
gettext coverage: %32.23 total msgs: 422 total covered: 136


Requirements: polib from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/polib

TODO:
- lots
- at the moment, this kind of breaks gettext (always
  returns the msgids instead of the translated entries).
- more detailed reporting
- only tested with nosetest v0.11.3
